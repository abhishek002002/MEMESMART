__NOTICE__ : You need frontend and backend to run concurrently in different terminal session, in order to make them talk to each other


So make two terminals now, __Terminal - 1__ for backend and __Terminal - 2__ for frontend.

## Server - side usage (PORT: 8081) *Terminal - 1*
```terminal
$ cd backend // navigate to the backend folder from the cloned directory.
```


### Start

```terminal
$ npm i       // npm install pacakges
$ npm start // start the backend server.
```

## Client - side usage (PORT: 3000) _Terminal - 2_
```terminal
$ cd frontend  // go to frontend folder from the cloned directory
```


### Start
```
$ npm i       // npm install pacakges

$ npm start // run the frontend locally
```
